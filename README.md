# Linux Wi-Fi Access Point: wlan78-ap

## 📌 Why this script?

- **Windows provides a built-in graphical tool** to create a Wi-Fi hotspot — but Linux does not.
- This project offers a **simple way** to create a functional access point from any Linux system **without complex config files**.
- This script is especially designed for people who don't have Ethernet access and want to use their Linux system as a Wi-Fi repeater of their existing Wi-Fi network.
- No need to touch any config file — everything is generated dynamically.

## ✅ Features

- Automatically detects a Wi-Fi interface connected to the Internet.
- Dynamically generates all necessary configuration files.
- Creates a virtual access point (`wlan78`) in seconds.
- Just type a password, and the AP is ready.
- Run `wlan78-ap reset` anytime to **reset and start clean** 

## 🧱 Requirements

Make sure your Wi-Fi interface supports AP mode (Access Point). It must be capable of acting as both a client (to get Internet) and a server (to share it) simultaneously.

Make sure the following tools are installed:

- `iw`
- `iptables`
- `dnsmasq`
- `wpa_supplicant`

## 💻 Usage

chmod +x wlan78-ap
sudo ./wlan78-ap

- You will be prompted to enter a password.
- Your access point will be created and start broadcasting.
- Connect with your smartphone, tablet or other Wi-Fi device.
- To check if your Wi-Fi interface supports AP mode, run the following command: **"iw list | grep -A 10 "Supported interface modes"**. You should see the word 'AP' appear.

## Very Important

- Your access point 'wlan78' may refuse to reconnect after a password change. Consider forgetting this network on your smartphone or tablet, for example, then reconnect using the new password.

## To reset the access point setup and start over:

sudo ./wlan78-ap reset
